v0.5.4
Updates:
- When importing, if files are found matching files already in database, the
    user will be prompted to update the directory of the files already in the
    database. If the user chooses to ignore, the files won't be imported and
    the existing files won't be updated

Bug Fixes:
- Undo stack is cleared if new database is opened



v0.5.2
Updates:
- "Import Files" feature now allows user to import specific files rather than
    entire folder
- Edit Tags dialog for re-naming and deleting tags.

Bug Fixes:
- New database isn't stored with App Data, causes failure to open
- Group tag very slow
- Opening DB fails when file(s) have unknown date. DB opens but several steps at end of process are missed.



v0.5.1
Updates:
- Photos can be rotated using Image Viewer
- Image Viewer now has Undo Buttons (tied to main application undo)

Bug Fixes:
- If Group Tag is used to remove tags only from any field, it will fail to do
    so.
- In filter tree in tag mode, if new tag is entered manually that matches an
    existing, exception is thrown and tag isn't checked.
- When typing quickly in free text filter, signals can get out of order and the
    pattern used is not the full string.
- Exceptions raised when closing and tagged photos are hidden. (Model is trying
    to access fields that aren't there because database was closed without
    notifying model).



v0.5.0
Updates:
- Updated database will require conversion
- Removed compatibility with pre-0.3 databases
- Added Delete toolbar button to Photo Viewer
- Add Copy To toolbar button

Bug Fixes:
- Group Tag warns "No Tags Selected" when only Mark Tagged or Un-mark
   tagged are checked
- All tag fields expand whenever picture changes in viewer.


v0.4.0
Updates:
- This release ships as installer executable, rather than zip file that
    must be extracted manually.
- Batch Tag (now called Group Tag) uses a checkable tag list
    rather than manually typed line edits. Now allows un-mark tagged.
- Tags checked in filter list will be matched exactly. Before,
   if one tag was contained in another, they would both match.
- Tag list in photo viewer for easy tagging of individual photos.
- Improved responsiveness of the free-text filter
- Add keyboard shortcuts and listing in help menu
- Add log window for error catching so application doesn't have to
    have console.


Bug Fixes:
- When tags with no filter checked, it disappears and can't be
    unchecked, leaving no way to re-show pictures.
- When all tags are deleted from a cell in the main table, all
    tags for that row are deleted.
