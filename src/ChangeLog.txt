v0.4.0
Updates:
- This release ships as installer executable, rather than zip file that
    must be extracted manually.
- Batch Tag (now called Group Tag) uses a checkable tag list
    rather than manually typed line edits. Now allows un-mark tagged.
- Tags checked in filter list will be matched exactly. Before,
   if one tag was contained in another, they would both match.
- Tag list in photo viewer for easy tagging of individual photos.
- Improved responsiveness of the free-text filter
- Add keyboard shortcuts and listing in help menu
- Add log window for error catching so application doesn't have to
    have console.


Bug Fixes:
- When tags with no filter checked, it disappears and can't be
    unchecked, leaving no way to re-show pictures.
- When all tags are deleted from a cell in the main table, all
    tags for that row are deleted.
